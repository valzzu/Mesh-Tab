# Mesh-Tab

# Disclaimer: this is not yet ready :) 
everything else seems to work expect powering from battery 



**Mesh-Tab** is a community-driven board design focused on creating experimental touchscreen nodes similar to smartphones. The project is divided into multiple stages, each with specific design goals.

![Mesht-Tab](/Images/Mesh-Tab/Mesh-Tab.png)

## Target Stages

- **Stage 1:** An ESP32-based touchscreen node designed for the new "Fancy UI" by mverchðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, with an emphasis on keeping costs low.
- **Stage 2:** A hybrid node that combines ESP32 and nRF chips on the same board. The ESP32 will serve as the GPU for the UI while the screen is active, along with touchscreen control. The nRF chip will handle LoRa communication for efficient performance. Once the screen times out, the ESP32 will enter sleep mode, with the nRF chip maintaining Meshtastic functionality.
- **Stage 3:** A fully nRF-based node with an eInk screen, aiming to incorporate a custom-made UI (not yet developed).

## Stage 1: Target Hardware
